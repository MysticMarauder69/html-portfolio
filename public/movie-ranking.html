<h1>The Best Movies According to Dani</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I enjoy feeling magical.</p>
<h3>Die Hard</h3>
<p>Because who doesn't love Bruce Willis in a tank top?</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Because Andy Dufrane dug himself out of a god damn prison.</p>
